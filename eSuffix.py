#plans for version 4
	#1: add verification to subfolders that checks if they are seasons example 'Season 1' or 's1' 
	#2: show the user information based on the IMDB search to verify it is the correct show. Information like cast, year, cover art
	#3: make sure the extention is a valid video file extention based on what VLC is compatable with
	#4:
